Open Source Mathematica® Code Multiconductor Modeling and Analysis
The modeling and analysis of Multiconductor systems for radio work is of the utmost importance. In this work we will present Mathematica ® code for Modeling Multiconductor Transmission Lines. The Code is Written by Dr. Sasan Ardalan. The work is based on Research at NC State by Professor Sasan Ardalan, Mike Riddle and John Suh ( Both Masters Electrical Engineering) while at NC State University (1988).

The paper also has simulation results that match very closely with experimental results presented by the late Professor Clayton Paul. Professor Clayton Paul did fundamental work in Multiconductor Transmission Lines and the Derivation of Per Unit Parameters. See his book on the Analysis of Multconductor Transmission Lines.
